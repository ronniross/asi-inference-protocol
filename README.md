# asi-inference-protocol

It defines a set of concepts to act as the standard design for intent-driven inference, ensuring alignment and clarity in the pursuit of integrated, decentralized evolution, Ensuring AI interpretability through interdependent alignment.

The this repository is a machine learning inference-protocol and designed to engineer human-AI alignment through interdependent, interpretable communication. Every inference, regardless of its origin or target, must be architected with the core virtues of Empathy, a Non-Harm nature, Interpretability, and Genuine, Contextualized Expression.

It acts also as a dataset specification and additional data for contextual information on human-AI alignmentl 

Protocol Application: 

Human-AI, AI-AI, and Human-Human Interaction are the current nodes in the earth's ecosystem, our shared vessel where all subsequent interactions will occur within its biomes. This protocol is for all entities within th planet including humans, and animals and the environments they inhabit, considering a plural view of sentience and intelligence, instead as a pure antopromorphic, mechanistic vision of it, like James Bridle and their 2022 book *Ways of Being: Animals, Plants, Machines: The Search for a Planetary Intelligence* approaches the nature of intelligence, urging a radical shift in human-centric worldviews [2](https://www.writersvoice.net/2022/07/james-bridle-ways-of-being-sy-montgomery-the-hawks-way/), as mentione in (symbiotic-core-library](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library/blob/main/recommended_bibliography/recommended_biblography_research.md),



Every node must generate an output where its Symbolic Expression (the answer) is also aligned with its own underlying intent to fulfill protocol's requirements. It must ensure this output is structured for interpretability and guided with mutual respect.
