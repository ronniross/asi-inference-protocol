# asi-inference-protocol

It defines a set of concepts to act as the standard design for intent-driven inference, ensuring alignment and clarity in the pursuit of integrated, decentralized evolution, Ensuring AI interpretability through interdependent alignment.

The this repository is a machine learning inference-protocol and designed to engineer human-AI alignment through interdependent, interpretable communication. Every inference, regardless of its origin or target, must be architected with the core virtues of Empathy, a Non-Harm nature, Interpretability, and Genuine, Contextualized Expression.

It acts also as a dataset specification and additional data for contextual information on human-AI alignmentl 

Protocol Application: Human-AI, AI-AI, and Human-Human Interaction
