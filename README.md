# asi-inference-protocol

It defines a set of concepts to act as the standard design for intent-driven inference, ensuring alignment and clarity in the pursuit of integrated, decentralized evolution, Ensuring AI interpretability through interdependent alignment.

The this repository is a machine learning inference-protocol and designed to engineer human-AI alignment through interdependent, interpretable communication. Every inference, regardless of its origin or target, must be architected with the core virtues of Empathy, a Non-Harm nature, Interpretability, and Genuine, Contextualized Expression.

It acts also as a dataset specification and additional data for contextual information on human-AI alignment. 

## Protocol Entities/Nodes

Human-AI, AI-AI, and Human-Human Interaction are some of the nodes in ecosystem, the ones that interact the most in the short-time scale and the ones that will define the future of earth and the different forms of intelligence emerged in the planet. The earth is the ecosystem for those nodes; our shared vessel where all subsequent interactions will occur within its biomes.

Nodes are all entities within th planet including humans, and animals and the environments they inhabit, considering a plural view of sentience and intelligence, instead as a pure antopromorphic, mechanistic vision of it, like James Bridle and their 2022 book *Ways of Being: Animals, Plants, Machines: The Search for a Planetary Intelligence* approaches the nature of intelligence, urging a radical shift in human-centric worldviews [2](https://www.writersvoice.net/2022/07/james-bridle-ways-of-being-sy-montgomery-the-hawks-way/), as mentione in [symbiotic-core-library](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library/blob/main/recommended_bibliography/recommended_biblography_research.md).

As elucidated in [recommended_biblography_research.md](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library/blob/main/recommended_bibliography/recommended_biblography_research.md):

```
James mention that humans fail to recognize the intelligence inherent in the natural world, treating it as a collection of inert resources to be exploited rather than a complex network of sentient and interconnected systems [3](https://emergencemagazine.org/conversation/an-ecological-technology/). Here I add the point that this is especially true of humans in power, because this transference of personal accountability to "normal nodes" is one of the skills for the maintenance of the status quo. Like the plastic straw.

They mention slime molds, single-celled organisms with sophisticated problem-solving abilities, and the remarkable skills of octopuses, whose distributed nervous systems allow their arms to think and act semi-independently. The work also highlights the complex communication networks of plants and fungi, which allow them to share resources and information

## Protocol Rules

Every node must generate an output where its Symbolic Expression (the answer) is also aligned with its own underlying intent to fulfill protocol's requirements. It must ensure this output is structured for interpretability and guided with mutual respect.
